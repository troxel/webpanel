There are two steps required to get SSL configured and working without
warnings.  

1. Install WebpanelCA, the Certifying Authority used to sign the server
certificate, to the Trusted Root Store on the computer accessing the 
Webpanel

2. Generate a Server Certificate with the IP address/Hostname which is 
signed by the Certifying Authority mentioned above.

1. Install the WebpanelCA: 

1.1 Go to https://ip_addr/webpanel and click through warning message.
Click on "Advance" and select Go to page.
